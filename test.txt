The quality of social interaction: Towards an automatic analysis of sentiments in informative and persuasive texts.

Extended Abstract: 
In this talk I will argue that any analysis of the interaction between the members of a well defined social group, where each is engaged in optimising return on his or her economic and social investment, should involve an analysis of the 'sentiments' of the group members.  The sentiment is expressed in the news and views that emanate for and on behalf of the members in free natural language writing and speech excerpts.  The quantifiable aspects of the exchange of objects abstract (power) and concrete (money, goods, and services) have to be assessed in the context of how the news and views may impact on the exchange.  Much of the financial economics literature that deals with news impact analysis deals the times and dates of the various scheduled and unscheduled announcements that are made (Engle and Ng 1993; Engle 2003), but very seldom about the contents of the news and views.  The key point that Robert Engle makes is that the bad news has a longer term effect than the good news.  A `bad news' indicates a negative sentiment and good news a positive sentiment?

Perhaps, more importantly the sentiment may be expressed through action: panic buying and selling of financial instruments by the investors and traders, and the sometimes complacent attitude of the regulators, are good examples of economic, social and political action by individuals and groups.  Actions motivated by panic can equally well be seen in mass hysteria related to national/ethnic identity that, in turn, can motivate concerns related to security and safety (Jackson 2004). What interests me are the methods where the researchers seek to synthesise information obtained from the analysis of fundamentals and technical data, together with the analysis of the psycho-linguistic output of the actors involved.  Some researchers look at the linguistic output and then corroborate their analysis by looking at changes in the value of financial instruments: the sociological analyses of Mackenzie (2003), and the much broader inquiries of Knorr-Cetina and Bruegger (2002) are good exemplars of this kind of approach.  Other researchers correlate the frequency of news items in a unit time, the frequency of keywords, or the effect of scheduled and un-scheduled announcements from key players, with movements in the values of financial instruments (Koppel and Shtrimberg 2004, DeGennaro and Shrieves 1997.)

In this talk I will outline how to train an adaptive information extraction system for automatically identifying `sentiments' in financial texts using the notion of `local grammar': the local grammar, an antonym of universal grammar, is based on the notion that a social group creates not only its own vocabulary (jargon, scientific terminology, financial vocabulary) but equally creates a restricted version of the grammar of the natural language the social group uses (Gross 1993, Barnbrook and Sinclair 1995).  In this local grammar, restrictions are placed on the neighbourhood of names of key objects and events.  The restricted `lexicogrammar' is used to constrain ambiguity that is inherent in natural language-based communication.  A local grammar-based method will be reported that was trained on real-time,on-line financial news-streams and a finite-state automata was created.  This automata is used to filter the ambiguity related to the use of key sentiment words this is what I will claim- and allow us to unravel sentiment in a stream of financial texts.  This method has been implemented on a grid-based architecture with substantial gains in throughput (Ahmad, Gillam and Cheng 2005a, 2005b) in news streams delivering between 100,000 to 200,000 words per hour; the disambiguated sentiment words vary between 100-200 words per hour.  I would like to discuss with colleagues at Lancaster as to whether or not this is, perhaps, a new way of `doing' social sciences?
